Do you like pokemon?

I like it a lot, and to start learning about APIs and other web programming concepts, I decided to do a project involving pokémon.

So I made a kind of pokédex, with the first 151 pokémons. As I used a public API, called [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/), I decided not to make so many requests, from several Pokémon, so I only made them with the first generation.
